vid2gif
=======

An improved version of Lorenzo Carbonell's python script for converting video chunks to GIFs using a script based on a script by Douglas A. Augusto.
Requires: python2.x, mplayer, ffmpeg, mogrify (imagemagick), gifsicle, (ap)calc, du and coreutils



Improvement idea: add the possibility to embed subtitles.
Note: when is it dangerous to use the left Preview button? Upon pressing, the software reencodes the chunk of video chosen before playing it. When used on large chunks of video or on videos with extra high resolution, it can be a slow process. The button on the right is showing the chunk on the fly, which will be less accurate, but won't be as resource-consuming than the one on the left.
